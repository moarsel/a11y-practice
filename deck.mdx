#### Immersive web accessibility
<a href="/exercises/">Go to Exercises</a>
```notes
Thank you for coming today! 
What we're going to learn about today:
- the full range of users on the web
- understand how they use the internet, and hands on practice
- a framework for catching accessibility errors in your day to day work

How the workshop works (tone, safe space for questions).

## What is a disability?
<Image src='./images/Disability-Models.svg' size="100%" height="80vh"/>

```notes
Ask group: What is a disability?

Two ways to think about disability:
1) Medical: disability is an impairment of an individual. In this view, the solution is compassion or pity.
2) Social: there are variations among people that can be impairments, but disability primarily happens in social context because of:
- systemic barriers
- negative attitudes
- exclusion (purposely or inadvertently) 
```

## Disability = Abilities üèãÔ∏è‚Äç √ó Barriers üöß
```notes
Disability can only be fully understood in the context of each individual's abilities (or impairments) and environment.
It is caused by a mismatch between our capabilities and barriers and our environment.
For example, sidewalks with no curb cuts are simply not built for wheelchair users, parents with strollers, delivery people.

As web professionals to build an environment that a) minimizes barriers, b) improves capabilities.

The web is the infrastructure of the future and we are building institutions that can be inclusive or exclusive.
---

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

 -Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web, 1997

```notes
What capabilities does your current project give people, and how could barriers affect them?
(Ask your client as well).

### What impairments might our users have?

| Impairment    | Permanent       | Temporary       | Situational     |
|-----------    |-----------      |-----------      |-------------    |
| Vision        | Blindness        | Needs glasses | Sunny day         |
| Hearing       | Hard of hearing | Ear infection | No headphones   |
| Mobility      | Parkinson's     | Injury        | Hands full      |
| Cognitive     | ADHD            | Concussion    | Drunk or Tired    |

```notes
Everyone has impairments which vary throughout your life. 
You can be in a situtation that makes using technology more difficult, or have longer term impairments.
As we age, we will ALL have permanent decline in all 4 of these impairment categories.

### Assistive technology

<Image src='./images/assistive-tech.png' size="30%" height="40vh"/>

```notes
Software and hardware that enhances the capabilities of users. Anything from browser zoom (which we all use) to specialized hardware.
The huge range of assistive tech matches the huge diversity of abilities in people.
The internet supports a wide range of this technology by default and it's our responsibility not to break it.

# Accessibility Settings
<Image src='./images/system-preferences.png' size="30%" height="40vh"/>

```notes
What you can find:
* VoiceOver screen reader
* Screen zooming
* Display (high contrast, reduce motion, shake mouse)
* Switch Controls

Demo of switch on the exercises main page

# ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard navigation
* Used across a very wide range devices (e.g. switches, mobile devices)
* Used by a range of users (vision, mobility, cognitive, power users)

```notes
Raise your hand if you know the answer:

You can only focus on one thing at a time (true/false)
How to loop through form controls (tab)
The keyboard should focus on all text and controls (true/false)
How to navigate within a control, like a radio button (arrows)
How click a button (enter, space)
How to toggle a checkbox (space)
How to submit a form (enter)
How to click a link (enter)

Next: Begin exercises
```

## Keyboard cheat sheet

* <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Navigate every interactive element
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> - Navigate reverse direction
* <kbd>Space</kbd> - Activate form controls
* <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> / <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> - Move within form control
* <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Visit link or submit form
* <kbd>Escape</kbd> - Close open modal, popover, dropdown

```notes
- Keyboard demo on exercise page
- News website demo
- Movie night signup demo
- Catch errors on business sales website
```

## Keyboard functionality checklist

```notes
Brainstorm steps to put on a keyboard accessibility checklist:
    * You can push the tab key to navigate through every interactive element on the page (links, buttons, form fields, etc.)
    * Every item you navigate to is in a natural reading order matching the visual layout
    * You always can visibly see which element is focused on
    * All form controls can be activated with the space key
    * Links to other pages can be activated with the enter key
    * If there is a modal or popup window open, the keyboard focus always stays inside the modal when pressing tab
    * Important actions are not tedious to focus on
```

# Screen readers üîä
* Used primarily by people with low vision or blindness to *hear* the page content
* Also helps search engines, web scrapers, and other non-visual agents

```notes
Demo:
1) show where accessibility settings are
2) slow down rate
3) turn on
4) go to main exercises page and demo

```

# Voiceover Cheat sheet
* <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> : Turn on Voiceover
* <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> / <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> : Navigate items
* <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> : Click the active item
* <kbd>Control</kbd> : Shut up voice
* <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> : Open the rotary menu

```notes
Demo: screen reader on news website page - volunteers?
Exercise: Scavenger hunt
```

# Screen reader checklist

```notes
    * You should be able to perceive all content on the page, including images, with your eyes closed.
    * Every form element should have an understandable label (and any relevant validation messages should be read out as well)
    * Any notifications (pop-ups, errors, toasts) should speak out loud when they are triggered.
    * Should be able to browse with meaningful landmarks, links, or headings.
```

## Finding Accessibility Gaps 

* Summary of what we've learned
* What gaps are there?
* This one weird trick for catching errors

<Notes>

We've talked about our full range of users and their assistive tech:
- switch, keyboard, screen readers

But what gaps do we have?

A useful trick for catching more mistakes:
Empathize with a user with several impairments using your application (it could be a grandparent).

Impairment  |
Vision    	| Zoom-able page for low vision
Hearing   	| Captions
Mobility  	| Large tap targets for seniors
Cognitive 	| Icon + text for seniors, grade 9 reading level, common UI patterns, simple UI with no distractions, easy undo

Designing for so called "extreme users" has emerged as a best practice to create better designs for all users.
Ideally, we would validate our work with real users to know that it actually IS accessible.

# How can I use this?

<ul>
    <Appear>
    <li> Talk with the team and client about your full range of users and the impact of accessibility.</li>
    <li> Practice keyboard + screen reader tests on your project or on your own time.</li>
    <li> Quickly test before any new UI gets accepted as complete.</li>
    <li> Test whenever a full flow is completed</li>
    <li> Show off your tests during your demo!</li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
In your groups, brainstorm 1) challenges and 2) ideas of integrating this in your daily work.
```

```notes
Final thoughts: we have responsibility as the leaders in our field to build the web infrastructure in an inclusive way that makes it a better experience for everybody. 
(Just like engineers have a code of conduct.)
It will make our clients' products better and work for more people.
