# Don‚Äôt Break the Internet‚ùóÔ∏è
#### Immersive web accessibility
<a href="/exercises/">Go to Exercises</a>
```notes
Thank you for coming today! A11y can seem like a dry topic with lots of regulations to follow. 
Those details aren't as important as what we're going to learn about today:
- the full range of users on the web
- understand how they use the internet, and hands on practice
- a framework for catching accessibility errors in your day to day work

## What is a disability?
<Image src='./images/Disability-Models.svg' size="100%" height="80vh"/>

```notes
What is a disability? It's actually a tricky question. History lesson: medical vs social model.
Medical: disability is an impairment of an individual. Solution is compassion or pity.
Social: variations among people may be impairments, but disability primarily happens in social context because of:
- systemic barriers
- negative attitudes
- exclusion (purposely or inadvertently)

```notes
Because most people can step onto curbs, we made sidewalks wrong for decades.
We built a product for the public that excluded a minority of users with different abilities.
The result was a worse experience for everyone. (Tyler in Japan)
```

```notes
Curbs designed for all users are not only more inclusive, but better for everyone. 
People on powered scooters now have the technology and available design to potentially have better than average ability to navigate an accessible city.
Who else takes advantage of these curb cuts?
A study showed that 9/10 pedestrians would go out of their way to use a curb cut.

## Disability = Abilities üèãÔ∏è‚Äç √ó Barriers üöß
```notes
Disability can only be fully understood in the context of each individual's abilities (or impairments) and environment.
It is caused by a mismatch between their capabilities and barriers in their environment.

As web developers we want to build an environment that a) minimizes barriers, b) improves capabilities.
```
---
## Ok, but we're not building sidewalks...

```notes
The first time we built our roads (and schools, transit, etc.) we didn't account for all our users. 
The web is the infrastructure of the future and we can avoid making that mistake again.
```

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

 -Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web, 1997

```notes
Question: What capabilities does your current work give people, and how could barriers affect them?
(Ask your client as well).

### What impairments might our users have?

| Impairment    | Permanent 	| Temporary 	| Situational 	|
|-----------	|-----------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| Vision    	|           	|           	|             	|
| Hearing   	|           	|           	|             	|
| Mobility  	|           	|           	|             	|
| Cognitive 	|           	|           	|             	|

```notes
Exercise:
Abilities (and impairment) come in a wide spectrum (think Stephen Hawking)
 - cognitive, vision, speech, hearing, mobility
 - temporary, permanent, situational

Make 4 groups and think of the types of impairments for each category. 
The point is to see that the spectrum of abilities is very fluid and includes everyone.
```

### Assistive technology

```notes
Gives new set of capabilities to users.
The huge range of hardware and software tech matches the huge diversity of abilities in people.

## üôÄ Seems impossible?
# Don't panic!
```notes
The web was designed to be accessible from the start, and WCAG guidelines tell us how to avoid creating barriers for our users.
```
---
<Image src='./images/interaction-model.png'/>

```notes
What does it mean, practically, for a user to not have any barriers to our web apps?
It's helpful to break it down:
They can perceive it (see, hear, touch).
They can understand it (content is simple, grouped into meaningful sections, what actions are available)
They can operate it (use it).

# ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard navigation
* Used across a very wide range devices (e.g. switches, mobile devices)
* Used by a range of users (vision, mobility, cognitive, power users)

```notes
Raise your hand if you know the answer:

You can only focus on one thing at a time (true/false)
How to loop through form controls (tab)
The keyboard should focus on all text and controls (true/false)
How to navigate within a control, like a radio button (arrows)
How click a button (enter, space)
How to toggle a checkbox (space)
How to submit a form (enter)
How to click a link (enter)
```

## Keyboard functionality checklist

<ul>
    <Appear>
    <li>You can push the tab key to navigate through every interactive element on the page (links, buttons, form fields, etc.)</li>
    <li>Every item you navigate to is in a natural reading order matching the visual layout</li>
    <li>You always can visibly see which element is focused on</li>
    <li>All form controls can be activated with the space key</li>
    <li>Links to other pages can be activated with the enter key</li>
    <li>If there is a modal or popup window open, the keyboard focus always stays inside the modal when pressing tab</li>
    <li>Important actions are not tedious to focus on</li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

# Screen readers üîä
* Used primarily by people with low vision or blindness
* Also helps search engines, web scrapers, and other non-visual agents

```notes
Demo: show where accessibility settings are, slow down rate, and then turn on.

# Screen reader checklist

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>
        You should be able to perceive all content on the page, including images, with your eyes closed.
        </li>
        <li>
        Every form element should have an understandable label (and any relevant validation messages should be read out as well)
        </li>
        <li>
        Any notifications (pop-ups, errors, toasts) should speak out loud when they are triggered.
        </li>
        <li>
        BONUS POINTS: Use the rotary menu to browse Landmarks or Headings. These should give a logical overview of the page content.
        </li>
        </Appear>

## Where are our POUR gaps?

| Impairment    | Perceivable? 	| Understandable?| Operable? 	|
|-------------- |-----------	|--------------- |-------------	|
| Vision    	|           	|           	 |             	|
| Hearing   	|           	|           	 |             	|
| Mobility  	|           	|           	 |             	|
| Cognitive 	|           	|           	 |             	|

```notes
Framework for catching mistakes:
1. Think about the full range of user abilities and assistive technology different from your own.
(For vision it's screen reader, magnifier, old age, color blind)
Ask whether those people will be able to perceive, understand, and operate.
Operable: Keyboards yep, pointers, taps? Are buttons big enough?

Understandable: Hard to write rules (and WCAG was criticized for this), so the easier the better: clear heading structure, reasonable text size, layout, stick to common design patterns.
Bottom line: empathize with users  (especially cognitive disabilities) to drive good design: simplify, streamline, make intuitive.
